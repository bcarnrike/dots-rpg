# Demonstration of technical skills RPG
Personal turn-based RPG project that will demonstrate competence in systems design, programming and project management.

## What is this?
This is a project I'll be using to demonstrate a variety of skills I've developed while studying at SNHU. This project is unrelated to academic work, but will serve to show what I'm currently capable of in terms of software development.

## Why an RPG?
I chose an RPG (Role-playing game) because there are many systems that resemble those found in application or web-app development.
